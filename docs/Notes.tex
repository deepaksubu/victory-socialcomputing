\section{First Iteration}
There will be three tables
\begin{enumerate}
\item
images 

image id 

image location 

image name
\item
users 

user id 

user name 

user email id 

user rating
\item
concept

concept id

concept name

concept description

\item
transaction 

transaction id 

image id 

user id 

concept id

rating
\end{enumerate}

\subsection {Screens}
There will be a concept at the top which will define the concept of the image
There will be one screen/page which will have an image and a multiple choice below it.
There will be a done button at the bottom
\subsection {Transaction}
As soon as the user presses done, the transaction table will be populated with the selected rating.
\section{Django implementation}
The installation of Django is now completed on my local box and on the ischool webserver.
I am currently running a Django application which has the following functionality
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Loads an image from the table victoryimages and then displays it in an html page
\item
Gives an option of rating the image as good,ok or bad
\item
Depending on the vote, the rating of the image is increased or decreased
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Issues with the current feature}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
No User 
\item
No concept
\item
No link between user, image and concept
\item
Image only has rating
\item
The html is not pretty
\item
The flow is not yet clear
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Next aim}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Create a user login and logout functionality using Django's native user functionality
\item
Create a more robust database model which is in line with Django's user functionality
\item
Create a more clear url naming convention
\item
Decide on the exact flow of the application
\end{enumerate}
